# Chatty Pogonophobics Project

## Description
This application serves as a virtual chatroom for people who love Spider-Man and also hate beards. When the page loads, the user sees a series of pre-populated messages. The user can interact with the app in the following ways: adding a message, changing the theme of the page by clicking the 'dark theme' box, increasing the font size by clicking the 'large text' box, deleting an individual message, and/or clearing all of the messages. 

Skills demonstrated: ES6, JSON, XHR calls, modular code, dependency chaining, asynchronous code, DOM interaction, and debugging.
